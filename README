# Raytracer

An experiment to use LaTeX macros to create a small raytracer. Everyone was
doing their raytracer project in C++, Rust or other programming languages, and I
had a LaTeX book next to me so... yeah.

Warning, the compilation time is *very* slow, for a 200x355 image it took around
8 minutes on my laptop.
